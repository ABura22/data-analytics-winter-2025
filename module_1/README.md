### Do Before Class:  

_Edit the markdown file with an x in the checkbox when complete, then commit changes._

## Module Overview
In this module, students will explore the foundations of Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning (ML). Students will learn how ML uses data to make predictions and uncover patterns, the history and evolution of AI, and practical applications of AI tools in modern workflows. They will also gain hands-on experience using AI as a tutor and critiquing it's output compared with using Google or asking a human.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, students will be able to:
- Understand the basic concepts of Machine Learning and its reliance on data.
- Summarize a brief history of Artificial Intelligence.
- Identify and differentiate between various roles AI can play, such as a tutor and a coach.
- Recognize key AI tools like Claude, MidJourney, Bing, ChatGPT, and NotebookLM.
- Critique AI-generated output to assess it's validity, strengths, and weaknesses.

Computer Vision is a form of machine learning used in self-driving cars, facial recognition systems, and sustainable farming. Find out how a computer learns to classify images, how it can build from simple shapes to more complex figures, and why itâ€™s so difficult for a computer to tell the difference between a chihuahua and a muffin.

In this section, you'll learn about neural networks. Neural networks are computational models inspired by the human brain, consisting of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process input data by assigning weights, applying activation functions, and adjusting through training to minimize errors. They learn patterns and make predictions by iteratively updating these weights using algorithms like backpropagation, improving their accuracy over time.

#### Steps:
1. Find a medium-sized dataset (e.g., CSV file with 1,000-10,000 rows).
2. Upload the dataset to ChatGPT or another AI tool with data analysis capabilities.  
3. Use the following prompt for the analysis:  

> "Analyze this dataset. Provide a summary of key patterns, any anomalies, and actionable insights. Create visualizations if possible. Include an explanation of your methodology."

* Additional Notes 
   - For free AI tools, ChatGPT (with the free-tier Code Interpreter) or Bing AI are the best options for this assignment.  

#### Critique Guidelines:
- **Verification**: Compare the AI's analysis to your expectations or manually verified results.  
- **Positives**: What did the AI do well? Were the insights clear and relevant?  
- **Negatives**: What did the AI miss? Were there any errors in interpretation or visualizations?  
- **Reflection**: Discuss how this experience could influence your future use of AI in data analysis.
