# **AI Foundations Assignment: Evaluating ChatGPT as a Data Tutor**

## **Objective**  
This assignment aims to help students critically evaluate the effectiveness of using ChatGPT as a data tutor by analyzing its responses, comparing it to Google, and understanding when to use each resource for problem-solving. You will use your spreadsheet and pivot tables from your course pre-work to complete this assignment.

## **Instructions**

### 1. **Introduction**  
Write a short paragraph below describing the role of AI tools like ChatGPT in learning data analytics. Include your expectations for how ChatGPT can assist in your learning process.

AI tools like ChatGPT enhance familiarity with data analytics by being a tutor or a coach. I will use ChatGPT in my assignments when I do not fully understand the material. As I try to understand the material, I will ask ChatGPT to explain the concept to me. The goal of studying this way is to help me understand the material. If I feel that I need more practice after I have completed the assignment, I will ask ChatGPT to provide more data for analysis. This process will give me additional practice in areas where I feel weak.

### 2. **Data Task: Sorting in Pivot Charts**  

You will ask ChatGPT the following question:  
**_"How do you sort the values in a pivot chart by descending order in Excel?"_** (or Google Sheets if that is what you are using) 

- **a. Ask ChatGPT:**  
  - Screenshot ChatGPT's response and include below. 
  - Implement the instructions provided by ChatGPT in Excel or Google Sheets to test if they work.

- **b. Analysis:**  
  - Evaluate the response: Was the explanation clear? Did the steps work? Were there any errors or missing steps?  
  - Suggest how the explanation could be improved, if necessary.

ChatGPT told me to "Click on the dropdown arrow next to the Row Labels or Column Labels in the pivot table." The pivot table I wanted to sort was a table I had created from another table. I created this table to reduce the number of slices in my pie chart. Since it was not the original pivot table that I had created, it did not include a dropdown arrow. The second set of instructions were also confusing because it is missing a step. You need to be on the Data tab to see more sorting options.

To improve the instructions, I would include in the instructions to go to the Data tab in excel. Then click on a value from the data that I want to sort. In the section on the ribbon called Sort & Filter, I will click ZA, and the data will sort from highest to lowest.

### 3. **Comparison**  
- Use Google to search for the same solution (e.g., "sort pivot chart by descending order in Excel").  
- Compare the Google search experience to ChatGPTâ€™s response:  
  - Was the Google result more or less detailed?  
  - Did you find videos, articles, or blog posts helpful?  
  - Include any relevant link(s) you found helpful and explain why.

The result from Google was less detailed, but also less complicated. I was able to sort the data using the instructions given in the AI overview and I did not need to look at other websites. If I still would have been confused though I would have looked at [Microsoft support page](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/sort-data-in-a-pivottable-3f5e5db4-7ddf-44ac-8b9b-70050aa22523#:~:text=In%20the%20PivotTable%2C%20click%20any,Set%20custom%20sort%20options) to figure out how to sort the data. If I still had questions, I would have used the video tab on Google to find a video where I could watch someone sort data in a pivot chart and use the video as a guide.

### 4. **Pick Another Scenario*  
- Ask ChatGPT another data question as it relates to how to do something in excel/google sheets 
- Which resource you found most effective for this?

I asked ChatGPT how to use the quartile function. I found the instructions straight forward and easy to understand. When I put the formula into Excel there were no errors, and it gave the correct answer. From this I can conclude that there were no missing steps in the information. I asked ChatGPT for a dataset that I could use to practice in Excel, and I received a nice set of data that I could copy and paste into the spreadsheet. In addition to the data, ChatGPT gave me other formulas that I could practice and it told me how I would use the formulas. 

I asked the same question in Google. The instructions in Google were not hard to understand, but not quite as clear as the instructions in ChatGPT. The nice thing about Google was that I knew from which websites the answers came, and I could go directly to the source. Further, Google provided me with a video showing me how to use the formula.

Ultimately, I found ChatGPT most effective. I liked that I could ask for a dataset that I could copy and paste directly into Excel. I also liked the additional practice that ChatGPT suggested.

### 5. **When to Use Which Resource**  
Write a short response below explaining when it would be appropriate to use ChatGPT or Google. Consider factors like:  
- Time sensitivity  
- Complexity of the problem  
- Need for detailed visual instructions  
- Level of confidence in verifying the accuracy of the information  

Based on what I learned in this assignment, I would use Google when I am learning something new. Google will provide me with videos that I can watch and follow the steps within my own spreadsheet. That is, with Google I have a number of different videos which can provide visual instructions. I would also choose Google if the problem is complex. Having a video to watch will be easier for me to understand the new concepts. I have more confidence in the accuracy of the information on Google because I can see which websites the information is coming from. 

Conversely, I would use ChatGPT if the problem is not complex. It was easy for me to figure out the second question that I asked because the answer did not need to be as detailed. Another way I will use ChatGPT is for extra practice. I will ask for datasets that I can copy and paste into Excel so that I can practice what I am learning.

### 6. **Final Reflection**  
Reflect on your experience using ChatGPT vs Google and describe:  
- Which resource you found most effective for this task and why.  
- How this exercise influenced your approach to learning new data skills in the future.  

In summary, I found both Google and ChatGPT helpful. Google is helpful with more complex tasks because I can watch videos or look at examples on the Microsoft support website. I find ChatGPT helpful when I want to practice skills with which I am familiar because ChatGPT gives me datasets that I can copy and paste into Excel. I also can practice the skills that I learn with new data.
This exercise has opened my eyes about how I can use ChatGPT in this class and in the future. I am excited to use ChatGPT, as a tutor, to help me as I begin this journey in data analysis.
