# **AI Foundations Assignment: Evaluating ChatGPT as a Data Tutor**

## **Objective**  
This assignment aims to help students critically evaluate the effectiveness of using ChatGPT as a data tutor by analyzing its responses, comparing it to Google, and understanding when to use each resource for problem-solving. You will use your spreadsheet and pivot tables from your course pre-work to complete this assignment.

## **Instructions**

### 1. **Introduction**  
Write a short paragraph below describing the role of AI tools like ChatGPT in learning data analytics. Include your expectations for how ChatGPT can assist in your learning process.

AI tools provide instant explanations, and act as an on-demand tutor. They play a valuable role in learning data analytics by explaining concepts, methods, and terminology. They can assist with coding challenges, debugging, generating real world examples,clarifying statistical techniques, suggesting resouces for project ideas, etc. ChatGPT will allowing me to grasp concepts quicker and speed up my workload. Im excited to learn all I can!

### 2. **Data Task: Sorting in Pivot Charts**  

You will ask ChatGPT the following question:  
**_"How do you sort the values in a pivot chart by descending order in Excel?"_** (or Google Sheets if that is what you are using) 

- **a. Ask ChatGPT:**  
  - Screenshot ChatGPT's response and include below. 
  - Implement the instructions provided by ChatGPT in Excel or Google Sheets to test if they work.  

- **b. Analysis:**  
  - Evaluate the response: Was the explanation clear? Did the steps work? Were there any errors or missing steps?  
  - Suggest how the explanation could be improved, if necessary.

The explanation wasn't exact for me but guided me to play around to find the "sort" function. Instead of a right click, I utilized the sort & filter icon on  the top header and then needed to adjust what category I wanted sorted.

### 3. **Comparison**  
- Use Google to search for the same solution (e.g., "sort pivot chart by descending order in Excel").  
- Compare the Google search experience to ChatGPTâ€™s response:  
  - Was the Google result more or less detailed?  
  - Did you find videos, articles, or blog posts helpful?  
  - Include any relevant link(s) you found helpful and explain why.

I was able to dive into more specific details on the google search. This [link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/sort-data-in-a-pivottable-3f5e5db4-7ddf-44ac-8b9b-70050aa22523) was helpful for me to visualize what exactly I was looking for.
