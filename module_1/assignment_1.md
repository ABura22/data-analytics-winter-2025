# **AI Foundations Assignment: Evaluating ChatGPT as a Data Tutor**

## **Objective**  
This assignment aims to help students critically evaluate the effectiveness of using ChatGPT as a data tutor by analyzing its responses, comparing it to Google, and understanding when to use each resource for problem-solving. You will use your spreadsheet and pivot tables from your course pre-work to complete this assignment.

## **Instructions**

### 1. **Introduction**  
Write a short paragraph below describing the role of AI tools like ChatGPT in learning data analytics. Include your expectations for how ChatGPT can assist in your learning process.

AI tools provide instant explanations. As far as data analytics go, AI tools can be utilized to explain concepts, methods, and terminology. They can assist with coding challenges, debugging, generating real world examples,clarifying statistical techniques, suggesting resouces for project ideas, etc. ChatGPT will help me grasp concepts quicker and speed up my workload. Im excited to learn all I can! *I used ChatGPT to help me answer this question but modified the response to my own language and understanding. I will not use it for further open ended responses in this assignment.

### 2. **Data Task: Sorting in Pivot Charts**  

You will ask ChatGPT the following question:  
**_"How do you sort the values in a pivot chart by descending order in Excel?"_** (or Google Sheets if that is what you are using) 

- **a. Ask ChatGPT:**  
  - Screenshot ChatGPT's response and include below. 
  - Implement the instructions provided by ChatGPT in Excel or Google Sheets to test if they work.  

- **b. Analysis:**  
  - Evaluate the response: Was the explanation clear? Did the steps work? Were there any errors or missing steps?  
  - Suggest how the explanation could be improved, if necessary.

The explanation wasn't exact for me but guided me to play around to find the "sort" function. Instead of a right click, I utilized the sort & filter icon on  the top header and then needed to adjust what category I wanted sorted.

### 3. **Comparison**  
- Use Google to search for the same solution (e.g., "sort pivot chart by descending order in Excel").  
- Compare the Google search experience to ChatGPTâ€™s response:  
  - Was the Google result more or less detailed?  
  - Did you find videos, articles, or blog posts helpful?  
  - Include any relevant link(s) you found helpful and explain why.

I was able to dive into more specific details on the google search. This [link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/sort-data-in-a-pivottable-3f5e5db4-7ddf-44ac-8b9b-70050aa22523) was helpful for me to visualize what exactly I was looking for.

### 4. **Pick Another Scenario*  
- Ask ChatGPT another data question as it relates to how to do something in excel/google sheets 
- Which resource you found most effective for this?
 
I asked ChatGPT how to do a slicer in excel. Playing around in excel helped me figure this tool out best after following instructions for ChatGPT.

### 5. **When to Use Which Resource**  
Write a short response below explaining when it would be appropriate to use ChatGPT or Google. Consider factors like:  
- Time sensitivity  
- Complexity of the problem  
- Need for detailed visual instructions  
- Level of confidence in verifying the accuracy of the information

Chat GPT gives an overview, and if short on time, ChatGPT can speed up time spent working. If you need to sort through data fast, ChatGPT is better, or if general information is needed over a single perspective. Google is better for visual instructions, and for a more specific need. Both need checks for accuracy of infortmation, ChatGPT more so. I have less confidence in the responses generated by ChatGPT, and more trust when I can locate the exact source on google. 

---

### 6. **Final Reflection**  
Reflect on your experience using ChatGPT vs Google and describe:  
- Which resource you found most effective for this task and why.  
- How this exercise influenced your approach to learning new data skills in the future.

I found visual explanations more helpful for this task, which I located through google. In the futute if a quick ChatGPT search doesnt explain something to my satisfaction, I will then google to search for additional help.
