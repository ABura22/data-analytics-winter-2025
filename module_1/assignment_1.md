# **AI Foundations Assignment: Evaluating ChatGPT as a Data Tutor**

## **Objective**  
This assignment aims to help students critically evaluate the effectiveness of using ChatGPT as a data tutor by analyzing its responses, comparing it to Google, and understanding when to use each resource for problem-solving. You will use your spreadsheet and pivot tables from your course pre-work to complete this assignment.

## **Instructions**

### 1. **Introduction**  
Write a short paragraph below describing the role of AI tools like ChatGPT in learning data analytics. Include your expectations for how ChatGPT can assist in your learning process.

--- AI tools like ChatGPT are fast base output or give summary of any data given.  Sometimes it accurate sometimes it is not.  AI is useful to the extend of giving something like theory other than that I should rely on my own study and search through experiences to give the right result or summary.  Knowledge is more powerful tool than anything AI should only be an assistant helper not doer.

### 2. **Data Task: Sorting in Pivot Charts**  

You will ask ChatGPT the following question:  
**_"How do you sort the values in a pivot chart by descending order in Excel?"_** (or Google Sheets if that is what you are using) 

- **a. Ask ChatGPT:**  
  - Screenshot ChatGPT's response and include below. 
  - Implement the instructions provided by ChatGPT in Excel or Google Sheets to test if they work.

- **b. Analysis:**  
  - Evaluate the response: Was the explanation clear? Did the steps work? Were there any errors or missing steps?
  - Yes it did work with extra use of my own experience.
  - Suggest how the explanation could be improved, if necessary.

--- ChatGPT give good account of how to sort descending values on pivot chart for google sheet.  But it looks like chatgpt gave it on excel point of view not for google sheet.  I have to right click go to filter table then I was able to sort my pivot chart value from z to a.  This is a good example of my answer to question 1.

### 3. **Comparison**  
- Use Google to search for the same solution (e.g., "sort pivot chart by descending order in Excel").  
- Compare the Google search experience to ChatGPTâ€™s response:  
  - Was the Google result more or less detailed?  
  - Did you find videos, articles, or blog posts helpful?  
  - Include any relevant link(s) you found helpful and explain why.

Google search was much better than chatgpt, goole search provide videos to support or explain more clearly of what the searcher are after.Google search is much more productive than chatgpt.

### 4. **Pick Another Scenario*  
- Ask ChatGPT another data question as it relates to how to do something in excel/google sheets 
- Which resource you found most effective for this? 
---I asked Ai and on google search how to quick search for specific data on pivot table on google sheet.
  Google search again gave better and quick and accuracy answer to my question via videos and detail account, while chatgpt gave long text with no video and long coding to an advance data analytic level which I have no idea of.

### 5. **When to Use Which Resource**  
Write a short response below explaining when it would be appropriate to use ChatGPT or Google. Consider factors like:  
- Time sensitivity  
- Complexity of the problem  
- Need for detailed visual instructions  
- Level of confidence in verifying the accuracy of the information  

---Time sensitivity I rather use chatgpt, Complexity of the problem I will use google because they always provide videos where I can click around to find the right one I am looking for.  Visual insturctions will always be google because they provide videos not chatgpt.  Level of confidence in verifying the accuracy of the information will be goole search also. This questions verify to me that AI or chatgpt not best or better than google search for now.  Maybe in the future it will change but for now google search is more accurate reliable,solution for any problem but it will take time for time sensitivity AI is the go.

### 6. **Final Reflection**  
Reflect on your experience using ChatGPT vs Google and describe:  
- Which resource you found most effective for this task and why.  
- How this exercise influenced your approach to learning new data skills in the future.  

--- I come to the conclusion that google is most reliable and accurate than chatgpt.  It is also provide visual instrustions and more details.  Before this assignment I was one of those that hearc about cool thing AI does and thought this is where to go.  I now learned after doing this assignment that google is more reliable and still the number one reliable resources.  
After doing this homework I kind of calm down and sit down, relax and realize that Ai is good but google is better and best place to go to especially if i have something i need to clarify to help with my homework duirng  this course.
