# **AI Foundations Assignment: Evaluating ChatGPT as a Data Tutor**

## **Objective**  
This assignment aims to help students critically evaluate the effectiveness of using ChatGPT as a data tutor by analyzing its responses, comparing it to Google, and understanding when to use each resource for problem-solving. You will use your spreadsheet and pivot tables from your course pre-work to complete this assignment.

## **Instructions**

### 1. **Introduction**  
Write a short paragraph below describing the role of AI tools like ChatGPT in learning data analytics. Include your expectations for how ChatGPT can assist in your learning process.

---

### 2. **Data Task: Sorting in Pivot Charts**  

You will ask ChatGPT the following question:  
**_"How do you sort the values in a pivot chart by descending order in Excel?"_** (or Google Sheets if that is what you are using) 

- **a. Ask ChatGPT:**  
  - Screenshot ChatGPT's response and include below.

  - Implement the instructions provided by ChatGPT in Excel or Google Sheets to test if they work.

- **b. Analysis:**  
  - Evaluate the response: Was the explanation clear? Did the steps work? Were there any errors or missing steps?  
  - Suggest how the explanation could be improved, if necessary.

 The explanation was not clear as I was using Google Sheets the information ChatGPT was giving me it was not the option I was showing in Google Sheets. There was no "Descending" option and instead a A to Z or Z to A option. There wasnt any information as to what drop down to use when opening the editor for the pivot table.

### 3. **Comparison**  
- Use Google to search for the same solution (e.g., "sort pivot chart by descending order in Excel").

- Compare the Google search experience to ChatGPTâ€™s response:  
  - Was the Google result more or less detailed?  
  - Did you find videos, articles, or blog posts helpful?  
  - Include any relevant link(s) you found helpful and explain why.
 
  Googles information was more detailed as to how I get to the Pivot table editor, what section to look for and what a descending order would be in Google Sheets.
  I found that the steps on Google were more informative then ChatGPT. This could also probable be since we are using Google to find information breakdown for Google Sheets.

### 4. **Pick Another Scenario*  
- Ask ChatGPT another data question as it relates to how to do something in excel/google sheets

  My question was:

Help me find the average, median, and mode of the following chart and create it into a pivot table 
Household Income	COUNT of 	COUNT of 
$50k - $75k	128	23%
$35k - $50k	100	18%
$75k - $100k	86	15%
$100k - $150k	70	13%
<$15k	61	11%
$25k - $35k	49	9%
$15k - $25k	34	6%
$150k - $200k	23	4%
$200k - $250k	3	1%
$250k+	2	0%
Grand Total	556	100.00%


- Which resource you found most effective for this?

ChatGPT - Created a table and formaula breakdown to find the average, and gave me the calculation for median and mode.

Google - Created a more thorough break down as well as provided the formula for average but provided the answer for average, median and mode. 

### 5. **When to Use Which Resource**  
Write a short response below explaining when it would be appropriate to use ChatGPT or Google. Consider factors like:  
- Time sensitivity  
- Complexity of the problem  
- Need for detailed visual instructions  
- Level of confidence in verifying the accuracy of the information  

Depending on the problem of starting something from the beginning I would select google. I cant go to CHATGPT for something that is a quicker solution. I prefert to have a visual to guide me with steps to make sure my assortments creating a pivot table is accuarte. 

### 6. **Final Reflection**  
Reflect on your experience using ChatGPT vs Google and describe:  
- Which resource you found most effective for this task and why.  
- How this exercise influenced your approach to learning new data skills in the future.  

I believe due to the fact im using Google Sheets, Google would be best and provide a better break down for the information I am needing. If I were to be starting from the beginning of a pivot table and needing to create something I would have a better break down and visualization then I would get from Chat GPT. I have also learned during class that if you are more specific with ChatGPT in your knowledge of what you are aksing that you can get a better breakdown of steps as you get with Google. 

## **Submission Requirements:**  
Submit a link to your completed markdown file in this [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/Tech-Moms/data-analytics-winter-2025/discussions/4) thread.  
- **Due Date:** [Saturday, January, 18th]

### **Note:**  
Remember that critical evaluation is key in this assignment. The goal is to strengthen your problem-solving process by understanding the strengths and limitations of different resources, including ChatGPT.
