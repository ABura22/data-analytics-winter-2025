# **AI Foundations Assignment: Evaluating ChatGPT as a Data Tutor**

## **Objective**  
This assignment aims to help students critically evaluate the effectiveness of using ChatGPT as a data tutor by analyzing its responses, comparing it to Google, and understanding when to use each resource for problem-solving. You will use your spreadsheet and pivot tables from your course pre-work to complete this assignment.

## **Instructions**

### 1. **Introduction**  
Write a short paragraph below describing the role of AI tools like ChatGPT in learning data analytics. Include your expectations for how ChatGPT can assist in your learning process.

---
**Response:**
When it comes to learning data analytics, the role of AI tools like ChatGPT can help identify or explain which tools to use to render specific results. For example if I wanted to add a specific color palette to my pie chart on my dashboard and I didn't know how, I could enter in a prompt to get guidance. I find that ChatGPT is helpful with explaining concepts that I need further broken down and providing scenarios to help solidofy the information. I anticipate that ChatGPT can assist me in the learning process by helping me create a schedule for when I can study based on my engagements and availaibility. I can create a GPT where I have it ask me questions about data analytics and methodologies and I explain it back and get a score based off my response (I may actually build that out this weekend for myself). I believe that ChatGPT can help me articulate the insights I gather when it comes to presenting my findings. I also think that it will be very beneficial to me when we start learning Sql.

### 2. **Data Task: Sorting in Pivot Charts**  

You will ask ChatGPT the following question:  
**_"How do you sort the values in a pivot chart by descending order in Excel?"_** (or Google Sheets if that is what you are using) 

- **a. Ask ChatGPT:**  
  - Screenshot ChatGPT's response and include below. 
  - Implement the instructions provided by ChatGPT in Excel or Google Sheets to test if they work.
 
  - **Response**

- **b. Analysis:**  
  - Evaluate the response: Was the explanation clear? Did the steps work? Were there any errors or missing steps?  
  - Suggest how the explanation could be improved, if necessary.

**Response**
  - I feel that I was able to follow the steps that ChatGPT provided without any errors. From my perspective, what would make the instructions better is if the steps were more specific. For example, Instead of the part where the response was "In the pivot table, click the dropdown arrow next to the field you want to sort (this could be a row or column label)" It could instead say "In the pivot table, click the dropdown arrow in the row or column label that you want to sort."

### 3. **Comparison**  
- Use Google to search for the same solution (e.g., "sort pivot chart by descending order in Excel").  
- Compare the Google search experience to ChatGPT’s response:  
  - Was the Google result more or less detailed?  
  - Did you find videos, articles, or blog posts helpful?  
  - Include any relevant link(s) you found helpful and explain why.

**Response**
  - The initial featured snippet that Google provided was not very helpful, but once I clicked into the link from Microsoft I was able to see step by step details on how to perform the task on a Windows computer. I was also able to see pictures of the main steps which helps to make sure I am clicking in the correct area. The information that I found most helpful was this information article directly from Microsoft: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/sort-data-in-a-pivottable-or-pivotchart-e41f7107-b92d-44ef-861f-24430830450a#ID0EBF=Windows

### 4. **Pick Another Scenario*  
- Ask ChatGPT another data question as it relates to how to do something in excel/google sheets 
- Which resource you found most effective for this? 
  
**Response**
I asked ChatGPT the following questions: How do I create a bar chart from a pivot table?
ChatGPT provided a very long response that included all the steps on how to create a pivot table first before providing the steps on how to creare the bar chart from the pivot table. Since I already had the pivot table in place I disregarded the steps on how to create one and just focused my attention on following the steps for creating the bar chart. The only way where I think it could be more valuable is if it (ChatGPT) specified where to find the insert tab, for example, "Go to the insert tab at the top of the screen (next to the Home tab)." Because when I was on the Home page, there is also an "Insert" incon and I could see that causing confusion.

When I searched Google, I came across this video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zr_tdHmidRU  which was simple and straight to the point. I liked that this started straight from the already created pivot table with the directions. With ChatGPT it gave me the directions for creating a Pivot Table, but that wasn’t what I wanted. I found the video more effective than ChatGPT because I could visually see what to do.

### 5. **When to Use Which Resource**  
Write a short response below explaining when it would be appropriate to use ChatGPT or Google. Consider factors like:  
- Time sensitivity  
- Complexity of the problem  
- Need for detailed visual instructions  
- Level of confidence in verifying the accuracy of the information  

**Response**
I think it would be appropriate to use ChatGPT when the problem I am trying to solve isn’t too complex. For example, if I wanted to know where the “Insert” tab is located in excel. I think when a problem is complex ChatGPT will respond in a way that sounds educated and accurate, but in fact may not be accurate or it may hallucinate a response. I've seen this happen before when I uploaded a transcript from a usability test I did; when I asked ChatGPT to pull out 5 direct quotes from one of the participants, instead, it created one on it’s own by hallucinating. I feel like Google would be good to use when I have more time because I have to weed out the options it provides to find specifically what I am looking for.

### 6. **Final Reflection**  
Reflect on your experience using ChatGPT vs Google and describe:  
- Which resource you found most effective for this task and why.  
- How this exercise influenced your approach to learning new data skills in the future.  

**Response**
For this task, I found Google to be more effective because I had visual aids in the form of pictures or videos. However, I was able to utilize ChatGPT as well without issue. Even though I think ChatGPT could be more specific, I was able to understand the steps and execute them the first attempt. I feel that this exercise positively influenced my approach to learning new data skills in the future because I can use ChatGPT as a tutor to help locate how to do things within the different data software that I'll be using.
