# **AI Foundations Assignment: Evaluating ChatGPT as a Data Tutor**

## **Objective**  
This assignment aims to help students critically evaluate the effectiveness of using ChatGPT as a data tutor by analyzing its responses, comparing it to Google, and understanding when to use each resource for problem-solving. You will use your spreadsheet and pivot tables from your course pre-work to complete this assignment.

## **Instructions**

### 1. **Introduction**  
Write a short paragraph below describing the role of AI tools like ChatGPT in learning data analytics. Include your expectations for how ChatGPT can assist in your learning process.

The role of AI in Data Analytics is ever growing because AI utilizes information from many sources and continues to improve based on learning from it's mistakes, and increasing it's accuracy. For us in this class specifically, I think we'll have the opportunity to utilize ChatGPT to help with data collection, organization, help analyzing complex problems as a personal helper, or just for moral support.

### 2. **Data Task: Sorting in Pivot Charts**  

You will ask ChatGPT the following question:  
**_"How do you sort the values in a pivot chart by descending order in Excel?"_** (or Google Sheets if that is what you are using) 

Answer with ChatGPT: 1. Open the Pivot Table, 2. Locate the Field to Sort, 3. Sort by Values, 4. Sort by a Specific Value (Optional), 5. Refresh the Chart.

- **a. Ask ChatGPT:**  
  - Screenshot ChatGPT's response and include below. 
  - Implement the instructions provided by ChatGPT in Excel or Google Sheets to test if they work.

- **b. Analysis:**  
  - Evaluate the response: Was the explanation clear? Did the steps work? Were there any errors or missing steps?  
  - Suggest how the explanation could be improved, if necessary.

---For me it did not do what it intended to do in my opinion. It was a little bit generic, and it only let me see the data/sort option on some of the data points when I wanted to test it out further. When I did find some data that let me try it, I had a pop up that said, "Sort Warning: Microsoft Excel found data next to your selection. Since you have not selected this data, it will not be sorted. What do you want to do? 1. Expand the selection. 2. Continue with the current selection." The prompt didn't mention or advise what to do if this shows up. I tested both and one of them gave me a #div error on the numbers. So I panicked and did a control z, and the other option didn't do anything that I noticed. I think for this question I would further research videos that show me how to do it visually and then try it on my own instead of following this prompt. I would say maybe ChatGPT could improve by having visuals of examples or links to videos that better support it's idea/solutions. 

### 3. **Comparison**  
- Use Google to search for the same solution (e.g., "sort pivot chart by descending order in Excel").  
- Compare the Google search experience to ChatGPTâ€™s response:  
  - Was the Google result more or less detailed?  
  - Did you find videos, articles, or blog posts helpful?  
  - Include any relevant link(s) you found helpful and explain why.

---I do think that Google was more helpful for me on this one, specifically because I mentioned above that I would have prefered examples or videos, which I had access to look at and choose on the search page. So it was catered to my learning approach. And I was able to pinpoint exactly what I was looking for. I also think there might be an issue with my data assignment, so I will need some help at some point cleaning it up so I can try these examples a little more accurately for us next time. I did find one tuturial that was quick and easy to follow, it had visuals, he was easy to hear, easily explained. Clear and concise.

### 4. **Pick Another Scenario*  
- Ask ChatGPT another data question as it relates to how to do something in excel/google sheets 
- Which resource you found most effective for this? 
---
Question I asked to both Chat GPT and Google: How do you change values in your pivot table from numbers to percentages?

Based on the suggestions given to me on this prompt, I prefered the Google approach over the ChatGPT approach. ChatGPT was a written out explaination, which at first seemed a little daunting, but when I read it more closely it wasn't as intense. However, just based on my preference of learning style (visual/auditory) I prefered looking at the Google tuturials to get the information verified that I am doing it properly. 


### 5. **When to Use Which Resource**  
Write a short response below explaining when it would be appropriate to use ChatGPT or Google. Consider factors like:  
- Time sensitivity  
- Complexity of the problem  
- Need for detailed visual instructions  
- Level of confidence in verifying the accuracy of the information  

---
I would probably use ChatGPT for clarification on terminology, suggestions on how to phrase an answer better, or something a little more straightforward or less complex. Maybe for role playing on scenarios.

For Google, I would use this for the more complex stuff that would be helpful to have visual aids and tutuorials for my own peace of mind. Something that I would like to see maybe different solutions or ways to do something, or to have difference sources to enforce the answer I'm looking for. 

### 6. **Final Reflection**  
Reflect on your experience using ChatGPT vs Google and describe:  
- Which resource you found most effective for this task and why.  
- How this exercise influenced your approach to learning new data skills in the future.

For me personally, I was suprised to say I still prefer to use Google over ChatGPT for these types of questions. I don't use ChatGPT as much as most I think, but I have utilized it on a few occassions (more for personal humor than anything). Google is just better for me to retain and feel confident in my answer. I like seeing the problem be worked out in real example, so that it makes sense in my brain. And I like to follow along, to essentially dummy proof what I'm doing. 

I think it was cool to really see the difference in which I found more helpful, it was also cool to see how much ChatGPT can still grow. It's still a baby, and I'm sure will only continue to get better and better at providing solutions. But it makes me a little more confident in my ability to find the answer quickly the first time.
