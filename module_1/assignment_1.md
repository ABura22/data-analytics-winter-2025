# **AI Foundations Assignment: Evaluating ChatGPT as a Data Tutor**

## **Objective**  
This assignment aims to help students critically evaluate the effectiveness of using ChatGPT as a data tutor by analyzing its responses, comparing it to Google, and understanding when to use each resource for problem-solving. You will use your spreadsheet and pivot tables from your course pre-work to complete this assignment.

## **Instructions**

### 1. **Introduction**  
Write a short paragraph below describing the role of AI tools like ChatGPT in learning data analytics. Include your expectations for how ChatGPT can assist in your learning process.
1. Introduction: Writing Prompt
The role of AI tools like ChatGpt in learning Data Analytics is to provide people with answers to questions that they may have, it helps with creating content for projects, growing business or something simple as writing a formal email for work or personal. It can help you personally or professionally manage schedules or organizations, it can be used to learn new things that you may be curious to learn, e.g. learning to crochet, or learning to fix a garbage disposal.

### 2. **Data Task: Sorting in Pivot Charts**  

You will ask ChatGPT the following question:  
**_"How do you sort the values in a pivot chart by descending order in Excel?"_** (or Google Sheets if that is what you are using) 

- **a. Ask ChatGPT:**  
  - Screenshot ChatGPT's response and include below. 
  - Implement the instructions provided by ChatGPT in Excel or Google Sheets to test if they work.  

- **b. Analysis:**  
  - Evaluate the response: Was the explanation clear? Did the steps work? Were there any errors or missing steps?  
  - Suggest how the explanation could be improved, if necessary.
    
2. Data Task: Sorting in Pivot Charts
“How do you sort the values in a pivot chart by descending order in Excel?”



The instructions that ChatGbt gave were clear and understandable. These steps did work for me when I used them in Excel. I found that when I tried doing these steps in Google Docs it still worked, however some of the functions were located in different spots in google sheets than what I was familiar with in Excel.

### 3. **Comparison**  
- Use Google to search for the same solution (e.g., "sort pivot chart by descending order in Excel").  
- Compare the Google search experience to ChatGPT’s response:  
  - Was the Google result more or less detailed?  
  - Did you find videos, articles, or blog posts helpful?  
  - Include any relevant link(s) you found helpful and explain why.
    
3. Comparison
When using google to search for the same question “How do you sort the values in a pivot chart by descending order in Excel?” I found that it was just as useful as ChatGBT but that it populated more options right from the start such as articles, chat forms from Reddit and youtube videos on a step by step instruction on how to do it. Below is a helpful link I found on google for me it was more helpful as I am more of a visual and hands on learner so I was able to watch the video as well on a step by step guide

### 4. **Pick Another Scenario*  
- Ask ChatGPT another data question as it relates to how to do something in excel/google sheets 
- Which resource you found most effective for this?
  
  4. *Pick another scenario
Question I asked ChatGBT “How can making pivot charts in google sheets be easier?”
I found that ChatGBT gave more enough information to help me navigate in making pivot charts easier for me to use in google docs as I am more skilled in Excel and have not used google docs at all so it has been a learning curve using google docs as my home computer uses google docs only.

### 5. **When to Use Which Resource**  
Write a short response below explaining when it would be appropriate to use ChatGPT or Google. Consider factors like:  
- Time sensitivity  
- Complexity of the problem  
- Need for detailed visual instructions  
- Level of confidence in verifying the accuracy of the information
   
5. When to use which resource
In my opinion the need to use either one of these would vary depending on the complexity of what I am learning. I have used google a lot of years in my life for everything so I have been accustomed to using it anytime I needed. It is nice knowing that there are other resources I can use in the future that can give me similar results. If I wanted to be more video specific I believe I would opt for using google, or a simple recipe. If I wanted to build a resume I would lean more towards ChatGBT as it gives you examples and formats wording for you to help make it more professional.

### 6. **Final Reflection**  
Reflect on your experience using ChatGPT vs Google and describe:  
- Which resource you found most effective for this task and why.  
- How this exercise influenced your approach to learning new data skills in the future.
