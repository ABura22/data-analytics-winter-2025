# **AI Foundations Assignment: Evaluating ChatGPT as a Data Tutor**

## **Objective**  
This assignment aims to help students critically evaluate the effectiveness of using ChatGPT as a data tutor by analyzing its responses, comparing it to Google, and understanding when to use each resource for problem-solving. You will use your spreadsheet and pivot tables from your course pre-work to complete this assignment.

## **Instructions**

### 1. **Introduction**  
Write a short paragraph below describing the role of AI tools like ChatGPT in learning data analytics. Include your expectations for how ChatGPT can assist in your learning process.
The role of AI tools like ChatGPT in learning data analytics is to help understand concepts and even write codes. I want to follow Alyson's advice and use this tool as a secondary source to get clarification and help, instead of the main source to do the assignments for me.

### 2. **Data Task: Sorting in Pivot Charts**  

You will ask ChatGPT the following question:  
**_"How do you sort the values in a pivot chart by descending order in Excel?"_** (or Google Sheets if that is what you are using) 

- **a. Ask ChatGPT:**  
  - Screenshot ChatGPT's response and include below. 
  - Implement the instructions provided by ChatGPT in Excel or Google Sheets to test if they work.

- **b. Analysis:**  
  - Evaluate the response: Was the explanation clear? Did the steps work? Were there any errors or missing steps?  
  - Suggest how the explanation could be improved, if necessary.
    The explanation was clear. However, when I started following the steps, I couldn't complete the last ones. Yes, there were some errors because I couldn't find some information on my Pivot Table.

### 3. **Comparison**  
- Use Google to search for the same solution (e.g., "sort pivot chart by descending order in Excel").  
- Compare the Google search experience to ChatGPT’s response:  
  - Was the Google result more or less detailed?
    More detailed
  - Did you find videos, articles, or blog posts helpful?
    Yes, a video 
  - Include any relevant link(s) you found helpful and explain why.
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gh3oLRd_XU&t=129s . The AI answer generated by Google was not very helpful. I think it gave the steps for Excel and not Google Sheets. However, the results showed that this video explained very well the steps. I love videos this type of videos that show you how to do this in a real scenario.

### 4. **Pick Another Scenario*  
- Ask ChatGPT another data question as it relates to how to do something in excel/google sheets 
- Which resource you found most effective for this?
  Google

### 5. **When to Use Which Resource**  
Write a short response below explaining when it would be appropriate to use ChatGPT or Google. Consider factors like:  
- Time sensitivity  
- Complexity of the problem  
- Need for detailed visual instructions  
- Level of confidence in verifying the accuracy of the information  
  Based on my personal experience so far, I think ChatGPT will be more appropriate when you need to get some information quickly meaning time is important. For the other elements, I will feel more comfortable using Google. I love the option to get visual instructions (videos) and also I know most of the time Google will display the most relevant and reliable information first due to the SEO patterns.  
---

### 6. **Final Reflection**  
Reflect on your experience using ChatGPT vs Google and describe:  
- Which resource you found most effective for this task and why.
For this specific assignment, my experience using Google was better. However, I am new to using ChatGPT and use the free version, so I don't know if this was a factor in not getting the information I was looking for. Also, I love to watch videos when I am learning how to learn new things, my brain works better. I can't get this type of help from ChatGPT
- How this exercise influenced your approach to learning new data skills in the future.  
It is too quick to make a statement because as I mentioned before, I am a beginner using ChatGPT. For now, I think my preferred source for getting help when I need to learn new data skills is Google.
