# **AI Foundations Assignment: Evaluating ChatGPT as a Data Tutor**

## **Objective**  
This assignment aims to help students critically evaluate the effectiveness of using ChatGPT as a data tutor by analyzing its responses, comparing it to Google, and understanding when to use each resource for problem-solving. You will use your spreadsheet and pivot tables from your course pre-work to complete this assignment.

## **Instructions**

### 1. **Introduction**  
Write a short paragraph below describing the role of AI tools like ChatGPT in learning data analytics. Include your expectations for how ChatGPT can assist in your learning process.

---As a data tutor, chatGPT assists users in exploring,understanding and applying data concepts.Guidance and examples tailored. Users to ask questions,receive instant feedback and 
iterate with concepts.

### 2. **Data Task: Sorting in Pivot Charts**  

You will ask ChatGPT the following question:  
**_"How do you sort the values in a pivot chart by descending order in Excel?"_** (or Google Sheets if that is what you are using) 

- **a. Ask ChatGPT:**  
  - Screenshot ChatGPT's response and include below. 
  - Implement the instructions provided by ChatGPT in Excel or Google Sheets to test if they work.

- **b. Analysis:**  
  - Evaluate the response: Was the explanation clear? Did the steps work? Were there any errors or missing steps?  
  - Suggest how the explanation could be improved, if necessary.

---When I read it I can understand it, but you must have knowledge to understand what it means and be able to follow the steps. If you don't have experience it would be difficult to follow the steps.It would be easier if I did it with drawings or charts to understand what needs to be done.

### 3. **Comparison**  
- Use Google to search for the same solution (e.g., "sort pivot chart by descending order in Excel").  
- Compare the Google search experience to ChatGPTâ€™s response:  
  - Was the Google result more or less detailed?  
  - Did you find videos, articles, or blog posts helpful?  
  - Include any relevant link(s) you found helpful and explain why.

---Both ChatGPT and Google are powerful tools that can be used for different purposes. ChatGPT & Google were more detailed because it showed you the web pages and also showed drawings with the details, it made understanding easier.But in the charGPT can creative writing,poems,stories, dialogues and data is limites to 2022 and the Google provides access to the latest information,news, and updates.

### 4. **Pick Another Scenario*  
- Ask ChatGPT another data question as it relates to how to do something in excel/google sheets 
- Which resource you found most effective for this? 
---This time the chatGPT was more detailed and showed me the boxes to make the changes I need to make in Excel.

### 5. **When to Use Which Resource**  
Write a short response below explaining when it would be appropriate to use ChatGPT or Google. Consider factors like:  
- Time sensitivity  
- Complexity of the problem  
- Need for detailed visual instructions  
- Level of confidence in verifying the accuracy of the information  

---Considering time, complexity in the problem,visual instructions and accuracy of the information, I would lean towards chatGPT because it is faster and more effective in resolving the questions I could ask. It could be on Google but it would take me more time to complete a topic.

### 6. **Final Reflection**  
Reflect on your experience using ChatGPT vs Google and describe:  
- Which resource you found most effective for this task and why.  
- How this exercise influenced your approach to learning new data skills in the future.  

---Most effective Resource for their complex topics and creative tasks is ChatGPT.
In order to learn dat skills in my development process I would have to use chatgpt to be able to understand and use the variants in my learning process.

## **Submission Requirements:**  
Submit a link to your completed markdown file in this [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/Tech-Moms/data-analytics-winter-2025/discussions/4) thread.  
- **Due Date:** [Saturday, January, 18th]

### **Note:**  
Remember that critical evaluation is key in this assignment. The goal is to strengthen your problem-solving process by understanding the strengths and limitations of different resources, including ChatGPT.
