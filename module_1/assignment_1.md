# **AI Foundations Assignment: Evaluating ChatGPT as a Data Tutor**

## **Objective**  
This assignment aims to help students critically evaluate the effectiveness of using ChatGPT as a data tutor by analyzing its responses, comparing it to Google, and understanding when to use each resource for problem-solving. You will use your spreadsheet and pivot tables from your course pre-work to complete this assignment.

## **Instructions**

### 1. **Introduction**  
Write a short paragraph below describing the role of AI tools like ChatGPT in learning data analytics. Include your expectations for how ChatGPT can assist in your learning process.

I can already tell that ChatGPT, and potentially other AI tools, will play a significant role in my learning process in this class. I couldn't even effectively do the prework without using it to assist me in the application of Excel in Mac. Large Language Models like ChatGPT can access the relevant information most needed within seconds, saving time, and adding more to my knowledge base with each response. I have started to notice the uses now, not just for this class, but in many other aspects of my day-to-day reality. It's exciting to start to experiment with the capabilities of this technology.

### 2. **Data Task: Sorting in Pivot Charts**  

You will ask ChatGPT the following question:  
**_"How do you sort the values in a pivot chart by descending order in Excel?"_** (or Google Sheets if that is what you are using) 

- **a. Ask ChatGPT:**  
  - Screenshot ChatGPT's response and include below.

  - Implement the instructions provided by ChatGPT in Excel or Google Sheets to test if they work.  

- **b. Analysis:**  
  - Evaluate the response: Was the explanation clear? Did the steps work? Were there any errors or missing steps?  
  - Suggest how the explanation could be improved, if necessary.
  The explanation was mostly clear. It was nice that it was organized into and ordered list with bullet points and headings. I 
  wouldn't say that there were missing steps, but it took a second to figure out a couple parts of what it was trying to say. Not 
  entirely foolproof, but close. It might have helped to add more specificity to the prompt since I am using a Mac.

### 3. **Comparison**  
- Use Google to search for the same solution (e.g., "sort pivot chart by descending order in Excel").  
- Compare the Google search experience to ChatGPT’s response:  
  - Was the Google result more or less detailed?
  It was less detailed, but added additional information on another option to sort through the Data tab.
  - Did you find videos, articles, or blog posts helpful?
  I am learning to not waste my time clicking on most links to videos or other site articles, etc. This is mostly due to anything 
  Excel seems to default to PC usage. 
  - Include any relevant link(s) you found helpful and explain why.
  I did not click on any links, but used the information generated by the AI Overview at the top of the page.

### 4. **Pick Another Scenario*  
- Ask ChatGPT another data question as it relates to how to do something in excel/google sheets
- Which resource you found most effective for this?
ChatGPT wins for this one. I asked the prompt, "How do you create a nice background for a dashboard in Excel for Mac?" It gave comprehensive and detailed instructions, as well as offering to share a step-by-step guide for an example background creation. Google was not able to answer the request in an AI Overview, and the first hit was Domo (a business). I did, however, get introduced to a nice YouTube video specific to doing this in Mac, where the presenter was holding a darling cat.

### 5. **When to Use Which Resource**  
Write a short response below explaining when it would be appropriate to use ChatGPT or Google. Consider factors like:  
- Time sensitivity  
- Complexity of the problem  
- Need for detailed visual instructions  
- Level of confidence in verifying the accuracy of the information
  Sometimes, if the question is simple and can be broadly applied, Google could be the faster option if the AI Overview can quickly answer it correctly. The more specific the need, or the larger the complexity of the issue, ChatGPT increases in its power to be the better solution of the two. As it continues to learn through the 2-way interaction in the process, the information builds to be even more beneficial. If, however, I need a more visual walk-through, I would probably take the time to find a YouTube video or similar source of information media.

### 6. **Final Reflection**  
Reflect on your experience using ChatGPT vs Google and describe:  
- Which resource you found most effective for this task and why.  
- How this exercise influenced your approach to learning new data skills in the future.  
 For the initial question, both the platforms were about equal in their benefit. However, I did have to add specificity of "Mac" to my Google search, but that isn't difficult, and may not actually have made much difference in the AI Overview. I saw two options with Google, but the option offered in ChatGPT was the quicker process of the two. So it's a coin toss for this one. Overall, though, I anticipate using ChatGPT pretty consistently in my work here.
