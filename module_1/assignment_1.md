# **AI Foundations Assignment: Evaluating ChatGPT as a Data Tutor**

## **Objective**  
This assignment aims to help students critically evaluate the effectiveness of using ChatGPT as a data tutor by analyzing its responses, comparing it to Google, and understanding when to use each resource for problem-solving. You will use your spreadsheet and pivot tables from your course pre-work to complete this assignment.

## **Instructions**

### 1. **Introduction**  
Write a short paragraph below describing the role of AI tools like ChatGPT in learning data analytics. Include your expectations for how ChatGPT can assist in your learning process.
---
I have never used ChatGPT so out of curiousity I asked it this same question. I was blown away by its response. Gone are the days from when I was in school of going to the library and using index cards and no computers; spending hours looking for the content instead of researching what is out there. We now have the ease of it not only at our fingertips but formatted to use. AI tools can as it states- "explain complete concepts, have on-demand problem solving, practical guidance, resource recommendations, mock interviews and test prep, and encourse creativity and innovation." My hope/expectation is that I can actually learn how to use ChatGPT and make it meaningful for use. It will be extremely helpful in my job if I can find more efficient ways of: analyzing data and reporting, project management, and staying up to date with the trends. 

### 2. **Data Task: Sorting in Pivot Charts**  

You will ask ChatGPT the following question:  
**_"How do you sort the values in a pivot chart by descending order in Excel?"_** (or Google Sheets if that is what you are using) 

- **a. Ask ChatGPT:**  
  - Screenshot ChatGPT's response and include below. 
  - Implement the instructions provided by ChatGPT in Excel or Google Sheets to test if they work.

To sort the values in a **pivot chart** by descending order in Excel, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Sort the Pivot Table
1. **Locate the Pivot Table**: Pivot charts are directly connected to their underlying pivot tables. Select the **pivot table** linked to the pivot chart.
   
2. **Select the Field to Sort**: Click on any cell in the column of the pivot table that contains the values you want to sort.

3. **Sort in Descending Order**:
   - Right-click on a cell in the column.
   - Choose **Sort > Sort Largest to Smallest**.
   - Alternatively, use the "Sort & Filter" option in the **Data** tab on the Ribbon and select **Sort Largest to Smallest**.

4. The pivot table will now display the data in descending order. The pivot chart will automatically update to reflect this change.

---

### Step 2: Verify and Adjust the Chart
1. **Check the Chart**: Ensure the pivot chart reflects the updated sort order. If it doesn't, double-check that the field you're sorting is the one used for the values in the chart.

2. **Refresh the Pivot Table**: If changes to the pivot table aren't reflected in the chart, click anywhere in the pivot table, go to the **PivotTable Analyze** tab, and click **Refresh**.

### Notes:
- Sorting must be done in the pivot table since Excel pivot charts directly rely on the pivot table’s structure.
- If sorting is required for a field in the **Row** or **Column** section, you can right-click on that field in the pivot table and apply the same **Sort Largest to Smallest** method. 

These steps ensure your pivot chart visually reflects the desired descending order of values.
- **b. Analysis:**  
  - Evaluate the response: Was the explanation clear? Did the steps work? Were there any errors or missing steps?  
  - Suggest how the explanation could be improved, if necessary.
I found the ChatGPT response very hard to follow and the steps did not work because I couldn't figure out what it was saying. I am a visual learner so any visual aids would have been super useful. It assumed you knew what you were doing instead of guiding you on what to do.

### 3. **Comparison**  
- Use Google to search for the same solution (e.g., "sort pivot chart by descending order in Excel").  
- Compare the Google search experience to ChatGPT’s response:  
  - Was the Google result more or less detailed?  
  - Did you find videos, articles, or blog posts helpful?  
  - Include any relevant link(s) you found helpful and explain why.
The Google search was much more detailed and it had as I like visuals. It also had different learning methods (ex instructional with visual). This youtube link was https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a60852orvZE

### 4. **Pick Another Scenario*  
- Ask ChatGPT another data question as it relates to how to do something in excel/google sheets 
- Which resource you found most effective for this?

### 5. **When to Use Which Resource**  
Write a short response below explaining when it would be appropriate to use ChatGPT or Google. Consider factors like:  
- Time sensitivity  
- Complexity of the problem  
- Need for detailed visual instructions  
- Level of confidence in verifying the accuracy of the information  

---

### 6. **Final Reflection**  
Reflect on your experience using ChatGPT vs Google and describe:  
- Which resource you found most effective for this task and why.  
- How this exercise influenced your approach to learning new data skills in the future.

### **Note:**  
Remember that critical evaluation is key in this assignment. The goal is to strengthen your problem-solving process by understanding the strengths and limitations of different resources, including ChatGPT.
