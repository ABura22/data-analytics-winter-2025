# **AI Foundations Assignment: Evaluating ChatGPT as a Data Tutor**

## **Objective**  
This assignment aims to help students critically evaluate the effectiveness of using ChatGPT as a data tutor by analyzing its responses, comparing it to Google, and understanding when to use each resource for problem-solving. You will use your spreadsheet and pivot tables from your course pre-work to complete this assignment.

## **Instructions**

### 1. **Introduction**  
Write a short paragraph below describing the role of AI tools like ChatGPT in learning data analytics. Include your expectations for how ChatGPT can assist in your learning process.

AI tools are a wonderful resource and of course, have their place in a learning environment. ChatGPT, while incredibly helpful, can also create barriers in learning if used to complete assignments instead of as an assistant/tool. I plan to use it sparingly, if and when a question is difficult to understand using Google, my preferred tool.

### 2. **Data Task: Sorting in Pivot Charts**  

You will ask ChatGPT the following question:  
**_"How do you sort the values in a pivot chart by descending order in Excel?"_** (or Google Sheets if that is what you are using) 

- **a. Ask ChatGPT:**  
  - Screenshot ChatGPT's response and include below. 
  - Implement the instructions provided by ChatGPT in Excel or Google Sheets to test if they work.

- **b. Analysis:**  
  - Evaluate the response: Was the explanation clear? Did the steps work? Were there any errors or missing steps?  
  - Suggest how the explanation could be improved, if necessary.

The instructions were clear and made sense. I misread them the first time so I was confused, but once I realized I was looking at it incorrectly, I was able to implement the steps quickly.

### 3. **Comparison**  
- Use Google to search for the same solution (e.g., "sort pivot chart by descending order in Excel").  
- Compare the Google search experience to ChatGPT’s response:  
  - Was the Google result more or less detailed?  
  - Did you find videos, articles, or blog posts helpful?  
  - Include any relevant link(s) you found helpful and explain why.

I found Google's response easier to follow. It was less detailed, but that's why it was easier. The very first result in the Google search yielded the result I needed.

### 4. **Pick Another Scenario*  
- Ask ChatGPT another data question as it relates to how to do something in excel/google sheets 
- Which resource you found most effective for this?

I asked how to use Conditional Formatting in Excel to both Google and ChatGPT. I found Google to be confusing and when I followed the outlined instructions, nothing happened. When I followed the steps outlined in ChatGPT, I was able to get a bar graph in place to look at the top 10% of cohort sizes. It's still confusing, but at least there's a visual to look at.

### 5. **When to Use Which Resource**  
Write a short response below explaining when it would be appropriate to use ChatGPT or Google. Consider factors like:  
- Time sensitivity  
- Complexity of the problem  
- Need for detailed visual instructions  
- Level of confidence in verifying the accuracy of the information  

ChatGPT and Google are both tools that can be used to assist in learning, but should not be depended on for everything. If I have a time-sensitive, complex problem that needs a succinct response, I will most likely use ChatGPT. Google provides another option if visuals/videos are needed to work through a problem. I have every confidence in myself that I am able to verify accuracy, and if something doesn't look right in ChatGPT, I have no problems in checking other sources for corroboration.

### 6. **Final Reflection**  
Reflect on your experience using ChatGPT vs Google and describe:  
- Which resource you found most effective for this task and why.  
- How this exercise influenced your approach to learning new data skills in the future.  

I found it interesting that one the one hand, Google's instructions were simpler and easily understood, while on the other, the same could be said for ChatGPT's directions. I don't think either one was more or less effective than the other, it just so happened that in this case, they were an even split.

I tend to forget about ChatGPT and don't use it often so it was a nice reminder that this is also a resource I have at my disposal if Google doesn't yield the results I'm looking for.
