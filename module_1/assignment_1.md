# **AI Foundations Assignment: Evaluating ChatGPT as a Data Tutor**

## **Objective**  
This assignment aims to help students critically evaluate the effectiveness of using ChatGPT as a data tutor by analyzing its responses, comparing it to Google, and understanding when to use each resource for problem-solving. You will use your spreadsheet and pivot tables from your course pre-work to complete this assignment.

## **Instructions**

### 1. **Introduction**  
Write a short paragraph below describing the role of AI tools like ChatGPT in learning data analytics. Include your expectations for how ChatGPT can assist in your learning process.

---ChatGPT and other AI tools can act as a tutor as I am learning data analytics. These tools will help me learng efficient ways and short cuts to gather, analyze and display data!


### 2. **Data Task: Sorting in Pivot Charts**  

You will ask ChatGPT the following question:  
**_"How do you sort the values in a pivot chart by descending order in Excel?"_** (or Google Sheets if that is what you are using) 


- **a. Ask ChatGPT:**  
  - Screenshot ChatGPT's response and include below.

  - Implement the instructions provided by ChatGPT in Excel or Google Sheets to test if they work.  

- **b. Analysis:**  
  - Evaluate the response: Was the explanation clear? Did the steps work? Were there any errors or missing steps?
  - Part of this answer worked (the descending feature). The part that did not work was how to begin editing the pivot table. My spreadsheet uses an edit tool at the bottom left of a pivot table instead of a right click with a pop up window asking to edit.

  - Suggest how the explanation could be improved, if necessary.
CHatGPT could improve by providing alternate editing options with the first step. It seems that ChatGPT isn't returning the best result first which led to confusion as a beginner in data analysis. Google returned this result first which is a quicker way to begin this data task.

### 3. **Comparison**  
- Use Google to search for the same solution (e.g., "sort pivot chart by descending order in Excel").  
- Compare the Google search experience to ChatGPT’s response:  
  - Was the Google result more or less detailed?  
  - Did you find videos, articles, or blog posts helpful?  
  - Include any relevant link(s) you found helpful and explain why.

---Googles result was more correct for google sheets. I'm guessing that ChatGPT may have returned an edit feature for Excel instead of Google sheets.

### 4. **Pick Another Scenario*  
- Ask ChatGPT another data question as it relates to how to do something in excel/google sheets 
- Which resource you found most effective for this? 
---

### 5. **When to Use Which Resource**  
Write a short response below explaining when it would be appropriate to use ChatGPT or Google. Consider factors like:  
- Time sensitivity  
- Complexity of the problem  
- Need for detailed visual instructions  
- Level of confidence in verifying the accuracy of the information  

---

### 6. **Final Reflection**  
Reflect on your experience using ChatGPT vs Google and describe:  
- Which resource you found most effective for this task and why.  
- How this exercise influenced your approach to learning new data skills in the future.

## **Submission Requirements:**  
Submit a link to your completed markdown file in this [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/Tech-Moms/data-analytics-winter-2025/discussions/4) thread.  
- **Due Date:** [Saturday, January, 18th]

### **Note:**  
Remember that critical evaluation is key in this assignment. The goal is to strengthen your problem-solving process by understanding the strengths and limitations of different resources, including ChatGPT.
