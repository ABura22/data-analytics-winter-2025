# **AI Foundations Assignment: Evaluating ChatGPT as a Data Tutor**

## **Objective**  
This assignment aims to help students critically evaluate the effectiveness of using ChatGPT as a data tutor by analyzing its responses, comparing it to Google, and understanding when to use each resource for problem-solving. You will use your spreadsheet and pivot tables from your course pre-work to complete this assignment.

## **Instructions**

### 1. **Introduction**  
Write a short paragraph below describing the role of AI tools like ChatGPT in learning data analytics. Include your expectations for how ChatGPT can assist in your learning process.

Chat GPT can help clarify information that is confusing, it can compile large data sets quickly, and it can help simplify concepts. It can also be used in everyday tasks like planning, prioritizing and even playing! There are multiple uses for AI in an educational and information processing setting, it's just about getting creative with it and ensuring the info and work are accurate. I feel excited about the possibilites of incorporating AI in this learning journey and what it can help me accomplish.

### 2. **Data Task: Sorting in Pivot Charts**  

You will ask ChatGPT the following question:  
**_"How do you sort the values in a pivot chart by descending order in Excel?"_** (or Google Sheets if that is what you are using) 

- **a. Ask ChatGPT:**  
  - Screenshot ChatGPT's response and include below. 
  - Implement the instructions provided by ChatGPT in Excel or Google Sheets to test if they work.

- **b. Analysis:**  
  - Evaluate the response: Was the explanation clear? Did the steps work? Were there any errors or missing steps?  
  - Suggest how the explanation could be improved, if necessary.
 
    So there were some discrepancies with the information ChatGPT provided and how things were actually labelled in Google sheets. For example, it said to click on the pivot table to display the values on the right side of the screen, but when I went into google sheets it was a widget at the bottom left corner of the sheet I needed to click on to display those values. There was also a missing step with the drop down menus, that was pretty easy to adjust once I started messing with things, but if I would have followed the exact directions I probably would have been confused. Overall, I felt it got me moving in the correct enough direction to accomplish the task, which is valuable for me rather than searching through a lot of info to find the exactly correct approach.

### 3. **Comparison**  
- Use Google to search for the same solution (e.g., "sort pivot chart by descending order in Excel").  
- Compare the Google search experience to ChatGPTâ€™s response:  
  - Was the Google result more or less detailed?  
  - Did you find videos, articles, or blog posts helpful?  
  - Include any relevant link(s) you found helpful and explain why.
 
    The Google search provided lots of different options to sort through information. Instead of just populating a direct answer, I was given options for articles to read, videos to watch, etc. For certain projects, especially those that require lots of step by step instructions, I would probably prefer watching a video. I do sometimes get frustrated trying to find exactly what I need in the video. It is rarely just there for you, and a lot of times I have to spend a bit of time sorting through extra info to try to find what I'm doing. With something simple like toggling a few buttons, I feel ChatGPT gives a close enough answer that I can figure it out with a little troubleshooting. I do think it would be harder for someone like my mom to use ChatGPT because she follows instructions to a T and that could present a problem if a few minor buttons are not in the exact place that it suggests.

### 4. **Pick Another Scenario*  
- Ask ChatGPT another data question as it relates to how to do something in excel/google sheets 
- Which resource you found most effective for this?

  I had even more luck with ChatGPT when I asked how to add additional spacing to the top of a line chart. It gave me exact steps that were very simple and really required no troubleshooting because they were exactly right. Google provided similar results but took much longer to sort through the reddit pages and youtube videos to get the exact answer I was looking for.

### 5. **When to Use Which Resource**  
Write a short response below explaining when it would be appropriate to use ChatGPT or Google. Consider factors like:  
- Time sensitivity  
- Complexity of the problem  
- Need for detailed visual instructions  
- Level of confidence in verifying the accuracy of the information

  Ok I feel I've included most of this in my above responses, but that's fine. I really think timewise it's way easier to get a quick answer to a simple adjustment problem with ChatGPT. I feel in a time pinch it would be my go to resource for sure. Very straight forward and simplified. If however I were doing a longer assignment, like the prework for this class, I would much prefer to watch a Youtube video and be able to go through the steps with an actual human. Same with something like changing my car oil...I feel I could find a youtube video of someone changing the oil for the same make and model car I have and feel a lot more confident that I won't error because it's not a broad sweeping solution, it's very specific and someone almost proving that it works to do it that way. Also visual instruction is so much more valuable for specific tasks and that isn't something ChatGPT could help me with. If I were trying to paint a tree I would much prefer google to ChatGPT.

### 6. **Final Reflection**  
Reflect on your experience using ChatGPT vs Google and describe:  
- Which resource you found most effective for this task and why.  
- How this exercise influenced your approach to learning new data skills in the future.

  ChatGPT was by far the most effective tool for this task. I got quick answers and didn't feel like I needed to sort through much to get the results I wanted. I will definitely be using AI to help with future questions on this type of material. I even feel it could help me with things I need clarity on as I am watching a youtube video or something...like they can really go hand-in-hand to help produce the results I'm seeking.
