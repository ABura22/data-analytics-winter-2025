# **AI Foundations Assignment: Evaluating ChatGPT as a Data Tutor**

## **Objective**  
This assignment aims to help students critically evaluate the effectiveness of using ChatGPT as a data tutor by analyzing its responses, comparing it to Google, and understanding when to use each resource for problem-solving. You will use your spreadsheet and pivot tables from your course pre-work to complete this assignment.

## **Instructions**

### 1. **Introduction**  
Write a short paragraph below describing the role of AI tools like ChatGPT in learning data analytics. Include your expectations for how ChatGPT can assist in your learning process.

The role of AI tools helps aid data analytics by providing step-by-step guidance and provide explanations for analytical outputs. By using ChatGPT, students see improved engagement and foster problem-solving and critical thinking, while providing personalized assistance. However, depending on the aggregate data, it might have bias limitations, due to collected responses.
Through learning about ChatGPT, I expect that it can help me in providing explanations to questions.  It can access datasets, clean data and save time by streamlining the data research to provide better data output.

### 2. **Data Task: Sorting in Pivot Charts**  

You will ask ChatGPT the following question:  
**_"How do you sort the values in a pivot chart by descending order in Excel?"_** (or Google Sheets if that is what you are using) 

- **a. Ask ChatGPT:**  
  - Screenshot ChatGPT's response and include below.

  - Implement the instructions provided by ChatGPT in Excel or Google Sheets to test if they work.

     Though I originally did it differently, it worked. Yay!

- **b. Analysis:**  
  - Evaluate the response: Was the explanation clear? Did the steps work? Were there any errors or missing steps?  
  - Suggest how the explanation could be improved, if necessary.

    The explanation was clear. Yes, the steps worked. For Excel users another option on Step 3. Instructions- is by going to the Sort & Filter Option from the ribbon on the “Home” tab

### 3. **Comparison**  
- Use Google to search for the same solution (e.g., "sort pivot chart by descending order in Excel").  
- Compare the Google search experience to ChatGPT’s response:  
  - Was the Google result more or less detailed?  
  - Did you find videos, articles, or blog posts helpful?  
  - Include any relevant link(s) you found helpful and explain why.

    -	I found the Google search results less detailed than ChatGPT
    -	Google does supply many resources to help with your inquiry
    -	Relevant Link: Excel Pivot Table: How to Sort by Values https://www.google.com/search?q=How+do+I+sort+the+values+in+a+pivot+chart+by+descending+order+in+Excel%3F&oq=How+do+I+sort+the+values+in+a+pivot+chart+by+descending+order+in+Excel%3F&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQIRiPAjIHCAIQIRiPAtIBCTM2NTg1ajBqN6gCB7ACAQ&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&sei=dNaJZ8WWHfWb0PEPkcG1iQ#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:8bf5d125,vid:siRqce7Pc5c,st:0, it demonstrates step 3 on Accessing the Sorting Option

### 4. **Pick Another Scenario*  
- Ask ChatGPT another data question as it relates to how to do something in excel/google sheets 
- Which resource you found most effective for this?

Google search vs. ChatGPT
  -	Again, I found the Google search results less detailed than ChatGPT, however it does give you what other people ask and other resources
  -	Google does supply many video and blogs resources to help with your inquiry
  -	Relevant Link: Conditional Formatting https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-change-a-cell-color-based-on-specific-text-input-in-Excel, it demonstrates how to change color values based on 
    specific text input

### 5. **When to Use Which Resource**  
Write a short response below explaining when it would be appropriate to use ChatGPT or Google. Consider factors like:  
- Time sensitivity  
- Complexity of the problem  
- Need for detailed visual instructions  
- Level of confidence in verifying the accuracy of the information  

ChatGPT is a great resource when needing a visually detailed answer and when time is limited. This could include when you are not at your computer and need a quick answer, or you are pressed for time with schoolwork or a work assignment and need a prompt answer or are needing to analyze a dataset, and it creates a pronto pivot table with some clean and pretty accurate data, yet potential biases and possible errors can occur. While compared to Google searches, which have more diverse resources. These are not as detailed and will require a little more effort in searching for your desired results. Google searches apply to students who have time and need to research and assess the accuracy of the available data information.

### 6. **Final Reflection**  
Reflect on your experience using ChatGPT vs Google and describe:  
- Which resource you found most effective for this task and why.  
- How this exercise influenced your approach to learning new data skills in the future.  

This was a fun interactive assignment. I wasn’t introduced to ChatGPT until a few months ago and have found it rather useful. I’ve learned you need to be very specific with how you ask questions, or re-write your question so it doesn’t take your question out of context, otherwise it will give you information that’s not real informative. The detailed answers remind me of a textbook, yet can’t totally be trusted. ChatGPT’s responses look rather professional, however, it might be missing some key information so this is where researching on Google is beneficial as it gives you many different options to find the best value in topic information.
